## Objectives
* Follow Agile methodologies/ Agile delivery
* Have working back end code
* Build the app mobile-first
* Build a functional website
* Focus on good UX

## Approach
* I started by reading the case study and taking note of the key problems that Schuester faces
* I then thought about how I could design a product that would solve these problems 
* I researched ways to improve UX
* I researched ways to improve social media presence, such as instashopping
* I researched whether or not it would be profitable to provide vouchers/discounts to online customers
* I created a Trello board so I could keep track of my progress
* I wrote a list of tasks that I needed to complete as a software developer and business consultant in order to create a product, and added these to my trello board
* I wrote user stories for the product
* I converted these user stories into tasks, and added them to the Trello board
* I decided which technologies I would use to build the product
* I created frontend and backened repositories for my code on Github, so I could practice continuous delivery
* I created slides to present to the client

## Technologies Used
* React
* Javascript
* Node.js
* Jest
* Heroku
* Netlify

## Challenges Scheuster faces
* A decline in revenue over the last 2-3 years
* Need to increase online revenue
* Few visitors to their store
* They are losing business to their competitor
* The experience of their website on mobile and tablet is poor
* They can only update their website every quarter, so cannot implement small changes easily
* Their website does not have a modern design, which is not good for the companies image or consumer trust in the site 
* It is not clear where to purchase, or the process to follow
* The returns process is not clear
* The delivery information is not easily accessible
* Too many customers are ordering the wrong size, as they do not have clear sizing information
* They lack a social media presence, linked to their website. They may benefit from an instashop
* Vouchers can only be used instore 
* Customers receieve information through the post only

## Solutions to these challenges
* We will encourage visitors to their store by focusing on brand imaging in which customer service (e.g. sizing help) is the focus 
* We will improve their image and popularity among consumers, in order to challenge their competitor
* We will improve the experience of their website on mobile and tablet
* We will follow an Agile approach to delivery 
* We will improve the UX of the website (user experience) 
* We will create a clear purchase process/ experience 
* We will build a clear FAQ section
* We will build an easily accessible delivery and returns info
* We will clearly display sizing information for each shoe
* We will create a social media presence, linked to their website
* We will create instshop functionality 
* We will create an automated email newsletter
* We will build functionality for vouchers to be used online, if this can be proved to be profitable

* why choose us to solve your problems?

## Impact of these solutions
* Improved customer satisfaction
* Fewer returns

## Next steps
* cost
* how long to build
* how to test the product
